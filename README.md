# Bot Version Log
V1:
Works: Yes
Improvement: First base model with a fixed acceptable price.
Notes: Technically runs, but the fixed value is too naive and can lead to one-sided trading.
PnL: N/A

V2:
Works: No
Improvement: Tried to move away from the fixed-price baseline.
Notes: Had errors and was discarded.
PnL: N/A

V3:
Works: Yes
Improvement: Uses best bid and best ask to create a midpoint-based buy and sell level.
Notes: Current record bot with Total PnL 590.
PnL: 590

V3.1:
Works: Yes
Improvement: Added more direct interaction with visible top-of-book volume.
Notes: Underperformed badly at around -1.4k PnL because the sell logic became too aggressive and asymmetric.
PnL: -1.4k

V3.2:
Works: Yes
Improvement: Keeps the V3 midpoint idea but improves buy/sell interaction by using symmetric take-or-quote logic and stepping quotes inside the spread.
Notes: Built to isolate execution-side improvements before moving on to fixed anchors or dynamic pricing.
PnL: 560

V4:
Works: No
Improvement: Experimental branch.
Notes: Did not work and is not part of the active path.
PnL: N/A

V5:
Works: Yes
Improvement: Added product-specific fair value handling and both taking and passive quoting.
Notes: Broader experiment, but not the current focus while testing pure buy/sell adjustments.
PnL: 540

V6:
Works: Yes
Improvement: Broader market-making version with inventory skew, quote edges, and product-specific fair value logic.
Notes: Saved as a separate branch so those ideas are kept while V3.2 stays focused on simpler buy/sell tuning.
PnL: 1'173
