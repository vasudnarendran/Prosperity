# Bot Version Log
V1:
Works: Yes
Improvement: First base model with a fixed acceptable price.
Notes: Technically runs, but the fixed value is too naive and can lead to one-sided trading.
PnL: N/A

V2:
Works: No
Improvement: Tried to move away from the fixed-price baseline.
Notes: Had errors and was discarded.
PnL: N/A

V3:
Works: Yes
Improvement: Uses best bid and best ask to create a midpoint-based buy and sell level.
Notes: Current record bot with Total PnL 590.
PnL: 590

V3.1:
Works: Yes
Improvement: Added more direct interaction with visible top-of-book volume.
Notes: Underperformed badly at around -1.4k PnL because the sell logic became too aggressive and asymmetric.
PnL: -1.4k

V3.2:
Works: Yes
Improvement: Keeps the V3 midpoint idea but improves buy/sell interaction by using symmetric take-or-quote logic and stepping quotes inside the spread.
Notes: Built to isolate execution-side improvements before moving on to fixed anchors or dynamic pricing.
PnL: 560

V4:
Works: No
Improvement: Experimental branch.
Notes: Did not work and is not part of the active path.
PnL: N/A

V5:
Works: Yes
Improvement: Added product-specific fair value handling and both taking and passive quoting.
Notes: Broader experiment, but not the current focus while testing pure buy/sell adjustments.
PnL: 540

V6:
Works: Yes
Improvement: Broader market-making version with inventory skew, quote edges, and product-specific fair value logic.
Notes: Strongest version so far and the current main branch to keep developing from.
PnL: 1'173

V6.1:
Works: Yes
Improvement: Keeps the V6 logic but tests small EMERALDS fair-value weight changes around the reference price.
Notes: Both small blend changes stayed close to V6 but did not beat it. The effect shows up almost entirely in EMERALDS while TOMATOES stays unchanged, so this does not look like the highest-value tuning path right now.
PnL: 1'169

V6.2:
Works: Not tested yet
Improvement: Returns to the original V6 fair value, then explores execution improvements with spread-adaptive quote edges, inventory-aware aggressiveness, softer same-side quoting near inventory limits, and less quote stacking after taking liquidity.
Notes: Built as the next discovery branch after the fair-value blend tests looked too small to matter.
